Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

For example,
Given [1,1,1,2,2,3] and k = 2, return [1,2].


Note: 

You may assume k is always valid, 1 &le; k &le; number of unique elements.
Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
