Given an array nums and a target value k, find the maximum length of a subarray that sums to k. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.



    Note:
The sum of the entire nums array is guaranteed to fit within the 32-bit signed integer range.



    Example 1:


Given nums = [1, -1, 5, -2, 3], k = 3,
return 4. (because the subarray [1, -1, 5, -2] sums to 3 and is the longest)



    Example 2:


Given nums = [-2, -1, 2, 1], k = 1,
return 2. (because the subarray [-1, 2] sums to 1 and is the longest)
