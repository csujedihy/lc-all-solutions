Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.



For example,

X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X




After running your function, the board should be:

X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
