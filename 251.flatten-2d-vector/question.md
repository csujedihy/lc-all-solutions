Implement an iterator to flatten a 2d vector.


For example,
Given 2d vector = 

[
  [1,2],
  [3],
  [4,5,6]
]



By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,2,3,4,5,6].

As an added challenge, try to code it using only iterators in C++ or iterators in Java.
